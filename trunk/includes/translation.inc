/* 	Yes these days of the week (dow) are supposed to be in lower case. The usage is in footer.inc. The logic is as follows:
		a) take the system generated dow and convert to lower case
		b) if there is a translation for the lower case date, use the translation
		c) if there is no translation use the dow generated by the webserver locale function
	So this handles the case where the webserver locale does not match what we want for weberp (use the translation available as first preference)
	and handles the case where there is no translation available (so the lower case date is returned untranslated which we know is wrong), 
		in which case we'll use the webserver locale function
	And we can translate sunday to Sunday even if the locale would not give us Sunday.
