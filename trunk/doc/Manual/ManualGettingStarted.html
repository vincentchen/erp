<ul>
<li>PHP greater than 4.2. The system is therefore operating system independent since PHP can be configured as a CGI module for use on MS IIS or as a module for Apache under either Windows (NT, 2000 or XP) or Unix/Linux. It has been tested under both windows (NT and XP) and linux. 
<li>MySQL greater than version 4, with Innodb transactional tables support - foreign key constraints are also required - these were added to Innodb in 2003. Innodb was introduced in 2001 to MySQL and has oracle like functionality - row level locking and database transactions with similar speed. (The system could be used with Oracle or other database systems, with minimal modification) An example configuration file my.cnf normally under /usr/local/mysql/var is available in the mysql documentation to show typical settings for the innodb configuration. The expected size of the data is useful although innodb can create an auto-extending data file and does so by default as of MySQL 4. All tables are defined as Innodb tables as of version 2.8.
<li>A web server. Apache - the software serving nearly 70% of all web pages - is recommended - but most web servers are supported by PHP in various forms the most popular choice on windows will likley be MS IIS.
<li>If the web server is accessible over the internet ie not just over a LAN then encrypted communications are required. The openssl and mod-ssl module for apache can be used easily to ensure all data is transmitted in encrypted form.
</ul>
Using apache with mod_ssl and openssl secure sockets makes sense and where there is any data transmitted over the internet and not just over a LAN.

Getting PHP and MySQL installed are well covered elsewhere - see the following links:
<br><br>
<a href="http://logidac.com/apache/apache-install-rpm.phtml">http://logidac.com/apache/apache-install-rpm.phtml</a>

<a href="http://www.linux-sottises.net/en_apache_install.php">http://www.linux-sottises.net/en_apache_install.php</a>
<br><br>
It is important to ensure that the php.ini setting for session.auto_start = 0. Some rpm distributions come with this set to 1 which makes it impossible to use classes within php code. Classes are used extensively in the system and the system starts sessions whenever it needs them - it is safe to set this  to 0.
<br><br>
The main issues with installation of PHP appear to be:
<ol>
<li>Some windows installations come with a setting for session.save_path= /tmp this is inappropriate directory for windows and it should be changed to session.save_path=C:\temp or something more appropriate.
<li>When the system is hosted on a multi-homed web server farm, the session needs a directory to be specified as a permanent directory otherwise alternative servers serving subsequent pages depending on the load at the time will not be able to find the session cookie. There is a config.php setting for $SessionSavePath this should be set appropriately for the web server host.
<li>For a reason unknown some servers are unable to obtain the correct directory automatically using the line: $rootpath = dirname($_SERVER['PHP_SELF']); This will be evidenced by the system's inability to find the page links for the various system options. If this happens the $rootpath variable can be set to the root path of the scripts directly.
<li>In some  IIS  installations the following message occurs and similar messages throughout the system:
<br>
Notice: Undefined index: AttemptsCounter in c:\inetpub\wwwroot\web-erp\includes\session.inc on line 20
<br><br>
A notice like this is not an error as such - it is acceptable to use variables without first initialising them in PHP. To avoid showing these notices a configuration directive in php.in needs to be modified. Look for the line in php.ini 
<br><br>
error_reporting  = E_ALL; display all errors, warnings and notices
<br><br>
and change it to :
<br><br>	
error_reporting  = E_ALL & ~A_NOTICE
</ol>
There is a configuration directive in config.php that sets error_reporting to the above for web-erp use as of version 2.8
<br><br>
The system could be used with many other database servers but it is tested and developed on MySQL. Independent benchmarks show that MySQL is at least one of the fastest for most common database tasks. It is especially fast at initiating a connection and due to the stateless nature of the web, a new connection is required to be established on every page - this makes MySQL particularly suitable for web based applications such as this.
<br><br>
The ftp library for PHP is only required for sending order files to a Radio Beacon ftp server for remote warehouse services.
<br><br>
Assuming that a web-server with PHP  functionality is operational and a MySQL server is available either on the same machine or on the network , a new installation consists of the following five steps:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Copying all the PHP scripts and include files to a directory under the web server root directory.
<li>Creating the database and populating it with initial data 
<li>Editing config.php for the database connection information and any other requirements 
<li>Logging into the system for the first time 
<li>Setting up company specific information in the system. 
</ul>
<font size="+2"><b>Copying the PHP Scripts</b></font> 
<br><br>
All files in the archive except the installation instructions in INSTALL.txt, web-erp-demo.sql and web-erp-new.sql should be copied to a directory under the web server root directory. This varies between installations but:
<br><br>
/usr/local/httpd/htdocs/
<br><br>
is the apache root directory under SuSE. Normally the Apache document root directory is called something ? "/htdocs"
<br><br>
Copy the archive to the this directory and then extract the archive andl create the web-erp directory under the web server root directory and put all the scripts in that directory.
<br><br>
<font size="+2"><b>Creating the Database</b></font>
<br><br> 
You need to know the user name and password for the MySQL server. If you have not set these up the default is
<br><br>
user root
<br>
password ""
<br><br>
BUT ... you should NOT use this account - you should set up another user for your mysql installation and change the root password to something other than "".
<br><br>
All instructions for using MySQL will refer to the command line client that comes with mysql. To run this under windows, a DOS box must be opened - from XP or 2000 click, Start, Run, enter cmd and click run. The mysql.exe binary is located by default under C:\mysql\bin\mysql.exe this would be the command line statement required to run mysql client, the options discussed below should be appended as required.
<br><br>
From the MySQL manual (edited):
<br><br>
" The MySQL root user is created as a superuser who can do anything. Connections must be made from the local host. NOTE: The initial root password is empty, so anyone can connect as root without a password and be granted all privileges. Because your installation is initially wide open, one of the first things you should do is specify a password for the MySQL root user. You can do this as follows (note that you specify the password using the PASSWORD() function):
<br><br>
You can, in MySQL Version 3.22 and above, use the SET PASSWORD statement:
<br><br>
shell> mysql -u root mysql
<br>
mysql> SET PASSWORD FOR root=PASSWORD('new_password');"
<br><br>
where 'new_password' is the new password you chose for the root user.
<br><br>
Also from the MySQL manual (edited):
" Also, if you have changed the root user password, you must specify it for the mysql commands below.
You can add new users by issuing GRANT statements:
<br><br>
shell> mysql --user=root -p 'new_password' mysql
<br>
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO weberp@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'some_pass' WITH GRANT OPTION;"
<br><br>
Where 'some_pass' is a password of your choice for the new user 'weberp'. Note that this user, weberp, can only connect from the local machine so if the web server is on a different machine to the MySQL server then you need to give privileges to connect from other computers. See the MySQL manual.
<br><br>
Innodb tables must be enabled in the MySQL server. These tables allow database transactions which are a critical component of ERP software. Innodb tables require some parameters to be set up in my.cnf - there are some examples in the MySQL manual under table types - Innodb tables.
<br><br>
If you have an account set up already in MySQL and innodb tables enabled, then all you need to do is to run one of the sql scripts.
<br><br>
Two scripts are provided:
<br><br>
<ol>
<li>web-erp-demo.sql This has a minimal amount of demonstration data with a bogus company set up so that transactions can be tried to see how the system works.
<li>web-erp-new.sql This script has only the basic data necessary to start a new company system off. If you wish to set up your company using the web-erp software, then this is the script to use.This creates a weberp database and populates it with only the very basic data to start off.
</ol>
The files web-erp-demo.sql and web-erp-new.sql should be in the directory with all the PHP scripts - first change directory to where the scripts are held then enter:
<br><br>
shell > mysql --user=weberp --password='some_pass' < /path_to_the_sql_script/web-erp-demo.sql
<br><br>
or
<br><br>
shell > mysql --user=weberp --password='some_pass' < /path_to_the_sql_script/web-erp-new.sql
<br><br>
as required - modifying the user entered here as weberp to the user you created in mysql for the purpose and the password stated here as 'some_pass' to the password appropriate for the user and also the path_to_the_sql_script to the appropriate path perhaps something like /usr/local/httpd/htdocs/web-erp/
<br><br> 
<font size="+2"><b>Editing config.php</b></font>
<br><br>
config.php contains a series of user defined variables that determine how the system behaves. Critically it contains the host (computer name), username and password of the MySQL connection required to connect to the MySQL server. There is no going forward without the system being provided with this data.
<br><br>
The default contents of the config.php file are as follows and must be edited in an editor of choice (KATE, Wordpad etc) and then saved in the web directory where the scripts are. However, the system is continually evolving and may well have changed since this was written.

Open a browser connected to the network upon which the web-server is also connected and enter the URL for the web server directory where web-erp is installed if the browser is on the same machine as the server then perhaps:
<br><br>
http://localhost/web-erp/index.php
<br><br>
enter the user name of 'demo'
<br>
password 'weberp'
<br><br>
(the quotation marks are not required).
You can set up additional user accounts from the System Setup tab and change the password. Be careful not to delete the demonstration user until a new System Administrator user has been set up. If there are no users defined the next time you try to login you won't be able to! In this situation the only way then to create a user to login with is to manually edit the SQL table WWW_Users to insert a user. If phpMyAdmin is installed on the web server as well then this can be achieved by adding a new record to WWW_Users.

<font size="+2"><b>Themes and GUI Modification</b></font>
<br><br>
Often what visually appeals to one does not appeal to another. Whilst accounting software is primarily about function - appearances do matter! Some flexibility is available with the color scheme and font sizes of the GUI using cascading style sheets. (css)
<br><br>
The user interface can be modified by adopting one of the defined themes or making up a new theme. There are currently only two themes defined in the distribution - 'default' and 'professional'.
<br><br>
In config.php the variable:
<br><br>
$theme = "professional";
<br><br>
can be changed to 
<br><br>
$theme = "default";
<br><br>
for a different look.
<br><br>
To make up a new theme copy the directory of one of the defined themes to a new name. The the themes are held under the css directory of the distribution, there is a directory under the css directory for each theme. Having copied the files to a new directory say 'New_theme' they should be edited to reflect the look desired. The variable in config.php should be edited to:
<br><br>
$theme = "New_theme";
<br><br>

<!-- Help Begin: WWW_Users -->

<font size="+2"><b>Setting Up Users</b></font>
<br><br>
Having logged in as the demonstration user. A new user should be defined whom has administrative privileges and the demonstration user should be deleted. From the menu click on the Setup tab and the select Set Up User Accounts, the users defined are displayed and User names must be 5 characters or more and the password entered must be 5 characters or more too. The password cannot also be the user name or contain the user name. It is not necessary to enter the full name telephone and other details. The access level selected is important as this determines the pages that the user can access. In any business where the employees are not also the owners it is advisable to split the functions between staff so that no user can complete an entire transaction. There are occasions in smaller businesses where this is impractical. However, the system has great flexibility to allow the user access to be finely defined. See the security schema section. 
<br><br>
As well as allowing the access to be restricted there is some flexibility about the links that are made available to a user. In the user account screen the system administrator can define which tabs of the main menu are activiated and available to the user.
<br><br>
There is also the facility to set up customers with their own logon. This restricts them to inquiries on their account including invoice re-prints and to entering new sales order. Customer logins do not allow any modification to the pricing. To do this the access level must be set to customer logon and the settings for customer logon in config.php must not be modified - ie $PageSecurity = 1 allowed only. In addition, the customer code and branch code applicable to the person logging on must be entered.
