<h1><a id="QA">Quality Assurance</a></h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The Quality module allows the users of webERP to define what they would like to test, apply those tests to certain templates or specific products (Items, Stocks) and then to capture actual test results on a Lot to Lot or Serial number basis. Outputs from the module include a Product Specification or Data Sheet and a Certificate of Analysis. Historical Results are kept and can be compared side by side for any particular Item. There is an option in the configuration that allows QA Samples to be automatically logged for Purchase Order and Work Order receipts if the product specification exists and the item is Lot or Serial Controlled. Also in the configuration are some disclaimers for specifcations and certifications.</p>

<h2>QA Tests Maintenance</h2>
<p>This is where all tests that will be performed are defined. Other specification related information can be captured here that isnâ€™t tested but describes in more detail the product specification. An example of this would be Processing Conditions for your product that you wish for your customers to understand. A specification is made up of any number of tests. The test defines outer tolerances but the specification allows the upper and lower bounds of the test to be specified.</p>
