<b>Adding a New Purchase Order:</b>
<br><br>

To add a new Purchase Order, Click on Main menu. 

<li>Select  Purchases.

<li>Click on “Add purchase orders”.

<li>Enter the suppliers name or supplier code and click search.

<li>Select the supplier that you want to purchase from . 

<li>Fill in the information for both the supplier and warehouse where the goods are going to be delivered.

The purchase order date,delivery date,Requisition Ref,ware house name, Address line 1to 4, telephone number,and the deliverers  ( all this is the ware house information and it has to be entered right) Then the supplier information that need to be entered include the address line 1to 4 that needs to be entered , the phone number, the payment terms , and there is a field to type in any comments if necessary.

<li>Click Enter line items.

<li>This will allow you to select  the stock category for the stock  items you want

<li>Click Search Now

<li>Select stock items  and quantities to appear in the order.

<li>Click order some.

<li>Fill in the prices and confirm the quantities by filling them again. If the quantities have changed, the changes are effected at this stage. This is because the supplier might not deliver all the ordered  items at the same time , and at this point  we need to record exactly what has been delivered, and not what has been ordered. Enter the prices,


<li>Click on Update order lines.

<li>Then click Process order.

This will give you a success report that you have created a purchase order.

You can save it, or print it.

After doing this you wait for the purchase order to be authorized by people who have the privileges to authorise purchase orders for example the directors or who ever in the company authorises.
<br><br>
<b>Authorising Purchase Orders</b>
<br><br>
Here the directors and authorising officials will log into webERP to look for purchase orders that have been raised and they will either cancel, reject, or authorise  these purchase orders .

       Below are the steps of authorising purchase orders

Click on Main menu

Click on Purchases 

Click on Orders to Authorize

The status of the purchase orders will be pending.

Drop this down and select  authorize ,  then click up date. 

This will enable the person who created purchase orders to print and receive them.
<br><br>
<b>Recieving Purchase Orders</b>
<br><br>
In order to Receive a purchase order, it has to be printed  first and sent or emailed to the supplier.
(N.B this can't be done unless the purchase order is authorised)

<li>A purchase order can be  printed as follows.

Click on Main menu 

Then click on Purchase orders .

Go to Search outstanding purchase orders and select the purchase order you are looking for.

You will see the options to  Print ,Receive or modify your purchase orders.(Highlighted in blue) then Click Print .

After printing this purchase order you can send it to the supplier through an email or print it out and post it.

<li>When the supplier delivers the goods to the warehouse , the stock manager will log into  webERP

<li>Click main menu 

<li>Go to Search outstanding purchase orders and click

  
<li>Click Receive

This will allow you to enter quantities  of  the ordered items again to confirm  what has been delivered. This is because some times the supplier might not deliver all the ordered items at once . He might deliver in parts. So these changes  are supposed to be effected at this point before processing a Goods Received Note.

<li>Then click update.

<li>Click on Process a Goods Received (GRN) And finally click on  Print a Goods Received Note (GRN). 

This is signed off by the person who received the goods and given to the supplier 
.
